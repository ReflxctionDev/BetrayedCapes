# BetrayedCapes
A Minecraft capes mod which gives Betrayed players a special cape

# Setting Up
## The mod will require you to do a few things before getting it to work:
* First of all you must set an API key. Simply do /api new and it will give you a UUID. Click on it as it will add it to your chatbox. Copy it and set it using **/bc key <key>**
* Second, you must cache the betrayed members. Just do **/bc cache** and it will do the job. Your game may freeze for a few seconds, but should be fast.

That's pretty much it, you will not need to do those steps again, however the mod will not work if not set up correctly.

## Commands:
* /bc toggle - Toggles the mod
* /bc key <key> - Sets the API key
* /bc cache - Caches the betrayed members
